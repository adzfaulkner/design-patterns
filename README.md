# design-patterns

## Synopsis

This project is a result of my reading through various resources relating to the Gang of 4 design patterns

## Motivation

Reading is one thing, thinking of use cases is another as more than likely each developer that is not familiar with design patterns have used them at sometime without even realising.

So I thought I'd challenge myself and instead of coding first, start thinking which programming task can be solved with a design pattern.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.5
* Composer
* PHPUnit

## Usage

1. git clone
2. composer install
3. phpunit
